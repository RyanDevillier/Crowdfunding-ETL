# Crowdfunding-ETL Analysis
## Overview
In our analysis, we used Python to extract specific information about the backers of different crowdfunding campaigns from the raw data that we were given.  Then, we "cleaned" this extracted data, again with Python, so that we could place this clean data into a SQL database.  After placing this data into our SQL database, we created several SQL queries so that we could find out more information about the backers of the specific crowdfunding campaigns that we were interested in.
